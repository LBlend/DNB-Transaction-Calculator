# DNB Transaction Calculator
A simple script that sorts your transactions by keyword and calculates the total amount. This makes you able to calculate how much you've spent in/on a specific store/service.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo
    `git clone https://github.com/LBlend/DNB-Transaction-Calculator.git`

2. Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    *Minimum requirement is Python 3.6*

3. Install xlrd
    `python -m pip install xlrd`

4. Make a new folder called `input`

5. Download your transaction data

6. Put the `.xls` files that you've downloaded into the `input` folder

7. Run the script
    `python calculator.py`

## To-do list
A list of features I want to add (*If I ever feel like expanding the functionality of this script*):
 - [ ] GUI
 - [ ] Support multiple banks
 - [ ] Multi-language support
 - [ ] Adding multiple sorting options

## Why does this exist?
I wanted to figure out how much money I'd spent on parking. I found it pretty tedious to enter all of my transactions manually into a calculator so I wrote a really simple script to do it for me. I figured I might aswell publish it because... why not? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
